# EQUITY RISK RATINGS BACKEND

## OVERVIEW
Our project is to ingest data on publicly traded equities and assign them historically validated risk ratings, which dynamically update based on market conditions. Our goal is to start with a small set of 25-50 companies and eventually cover all equities traded on US exchanges.
